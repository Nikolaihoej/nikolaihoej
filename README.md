<h2 align="center">Tools & technologies I use</h2>

<p align="justify">During my education, including my previous studies, I have accumulated a wealth of knowledge and various tools that have aided me in my journey as a developer. These are the technologies I have worked with the most and primarily kept myself updated on. However, this does not preclude acquiring new knowledge about emerging technologies.</p>
